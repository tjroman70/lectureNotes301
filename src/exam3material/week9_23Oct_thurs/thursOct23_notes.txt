HW 7 due Tuesday, October 28

/////////////////////////////

Today: 
- finish predicate logic
- mathematical induction

/////////////////////////////

Skipping proofs of DeMorgan's laws for quantifers to move on to induction.

Those would be great practice for next exam -- the proof files are 
    in week9_21Oct_tues

/////////////////////////////


Soundness and completeness of predicate logic.


Soundness: definition? everything that we can prove with our proof system   
    is actually true

    propositional: yes

    predicate logic: yes

    (same for any proof system)




Completeness: definition? we can use our proof system to prove 
    everything that is true 

    propositional: yes

    predicate logic: NO 


Premise: All x P(x)
Conclusion: Exists x P(x)

Not true when our domain is empty, but true any other time



///////////////////////////////////

Same argument might be VALID in one domain and INVALID in another

- deduction can only prove arguments that are valid in ANY domain
- we can't prove all valid arguments


Domain with integers with operations like +


All integers? 2 + 3 = ? 5


Subset (0,1,2,3,4) of integers. 2 + 3 = ? 0



////////////////////////////////////


Godel's Incompleteness Theorem.

Any consistent formal system where integer arithmetic is
carried out is incomplete -- there will be true statements
that cannot be proved.

(depends on domains/interpretations)

////////////////////////////////////////

Next topic: mathematical induction

////////////////////////////////////////

Example:

We want to prove that for any positive integer n:

    1 + 2 + ... + n = n*(n+1)/2


(Carl Gauss)


Try it out first.
    n = 1?

    n = 2?

    n = 3?


Have we proved it yet?



///////////////////////////////////////////

Mathematical induction.

Tool for proving some claim P(n) holds for all natural numbers n



The induction domino effect:

    ( P(1) ∧ ∀ k (P(k) → P(k+1)) ) → ∀ n P(n) 




What is this saying?
    P(1)? base case. prove that my claim holds for n = 1

    ∀ k (P(k) → P(k+1))? inductive step.
        for any natural number k, if the claim
        holds for k, then it holds for k+1.

        Pick a random individual in your domain (k).
        Assume P(k).
        Try to prove P(k+1)


∀ n P(n)? for any natural number n, the claim holds for n 




Putting it all together:

( P(1) ∧ ∀ k (P(k) → P(k+1)) ) → ∀ n P(n) 



English translation?
IF we can show the base case
AND we show the inductive step
THEN we can conclude that the claim is true for 
    everything in our domain


////////////////////////////////////

Why are we doing this?

////////////////////////////////////

Revisit our example:

We want to prove that for any positive integer n:

    1 + 2 + ... + n = n*(n+1)/2




Proof by induction.

Base case. We must prove that our claim holds for the first positive
integer, n = 1. We have that:
    1 = 1*(1+2)/2
The base case holds.

Inductive step. We assume the inductive hypothesis -- that
our claim holds for some fixed positive integer k. We must show
that our claim holds for k+1.

If our claim holds for k, then we have:
    1 + 2 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2

To prove our claim holds for k+1, we must show:
    1 + 2 + ... + k + k+1 = (k+1)((k+1)+1)/2

We have that:
    1 + 2 + ... + k + k+1 = k(k+1)/2 + k + 1 (by inductive hypothesis)
                        = (k(k+1) + 2(k+1))/2
                        = (k+1)(k+2)/2
                        = (k+1)((k+1)+1)/2

The inductive step holds.


We have shown with induction that our claim holds for any positive integer n.


/////////////////////////////////

(in-class quiz)

/////////////////////////////////

Do you think induction can be used to prove properties for
    ALL integers?

    must have a smallest value in the domain


/////////////////////////////////

Induction template.

1) Label base case. Prove the claim is true for the smallest element in
    your domain.


2) Label the inductive step. "Assume the inductive hypothesis - 
    that <insert claim> holds for some fixed k in <insert domain>".


3) Try to prove for k+1. "We must show that our claim holds for k+1".

4) Summarize. "It follows by induction that <insert claim> holds
    for all <insert domain>".

/////////////////////////////////

(skipped this example - we will do it on Tuesday)

Example: Prove that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n^2.

    (what is our domain?)


How can we express the sum of the first n odd numbers more formally?



So, what is our claim?



Proof by induction.


/////////////////////////////////

Example: Prove that 3^n - 1 is even for all positive integers n.


what does "even" mean? 
A number k is even if there exists an integer a such that k = 2a.



Proof by induction.

Base case. We must prove that our claim holds for our smallest positive
integer, n = 1. We have that 3^1 - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2. Because 2 = 2*1,
and 1 is an integer, we know 2 is even. The base case holds.

Inductive step. We assume the inductive hypothesis -- that 3^k - 1 is
even for some positive integer k. We must show that 3^(k+1) - 1 is even.

If 3^k - 1 is even, then there exists an integer a such that 
    2a = 3^k - 1

We have that:
    3^(k+1) - 1 = 3(3^k) - 1
                = 3(3^k - 1) -1 + 3
                = 3(2a) + 2 (by inductive hypothesis)
                = 2(3a + 1)

Thus 3^(k+1) - 1 is even since 3a + 1 is an integer. The inductive step holds.


We have shown with induction that 3^n - 1 is even for all positive integers n.

//////////////////////////////////

Bad induction, example 1.

Use induction to prove that in any nonempty set of n horses, 
all horses are the same color.

Base case. I have a set of one horse. Of course it is the same color.

Inductive step. We assume the inductive hypothesis, that for some 
fixed positive integer k, that a set of k horses all has the same color.

We must show that a set of k+1 horses all has the same color.

Exclude the first horse from our k+1 set. We would have k horses left,
and those horses all have same color by our inductive hypothesis.

Exclude the last horse from our k+1 set. We have k horses left,
and those horses all have the same color by our inductive hypothesis.

The two sets of k horses (the first k horses and the last k horses)
overlap (they share the middle k-1 horses in common), and so
they all must share the same color.


Problem: I made an assumption about k in the inductive step. 
The two sets of k horses do NOT overlap when k = 1.


//////////////////////////////////

Bad induction, example 2.


Use induction to prove that 8n+3 is even for all positive integers n.

(What happens when we skip the base case?)

We assume the inductive hypothesis -- that 8k+3 is even for some 
fixed positive integer k. We must show that 8(k+1) + 3 is even.

If 8k+3 is even, then there exists an integer a such that 8k+3 = 2a.

We have that :
    8(k+1) + 3 = 8k + 8 + 3
               = 2a + 8 (by inductive hypothesis)
               = 2(a + 4)


Problem? This claim isn't actually true, and the base case doesn't hold.
