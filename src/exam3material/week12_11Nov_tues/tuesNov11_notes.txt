HW 9 due tonight

    Algebra* justfication for Mac users

 
HW 10 will be posted after class, due next Tues

Exam 3 is Thursday, November 20
    (more information will be posted this week)

//////////////////////

Today:
- one more conditional verification example
- verification with nested conditionals
- verifying programs with functions

//////////////////////////////////

(abs.sc)

Example: absolute value

////////////////////////////////

Verify programs with nested conditionals.

Max of 3 numbers

-- see code

-- in each branch, what do we know about max?

-- finish verification

//////////////////////////////////

Function contracts - just under function definition:

Contract(
    Requires(
        precondition,
        precondition,
    ),
    Ensures(
        postcondition,
        postcondition
    )
)


Requires/preconditions:
- any assumptions we need to make about the parameters
- user must prove these requirements BEFORE calling the function
- list preconditions as PREMISES in first proof block in function
- can none or several preconditions


///

Ensures/postconditions:
- describes what the function returns (or what it changes)
    - use "Res[Z]" to mean return value (if returning Z)

- function has to PROVE that it is fulfilling the postconditions

- user can use a postcondition as a PREMISE in a proof block
    after calling the function

- can have several postconditions


/////////////////////////////////

Example: tickets.sc
- find the total cost of tickets based on adult/child numbers
- each adult ticket is $50, and each child ticket is $30

- what do we need as preconditions?

- what do we want as the postcondition?

--> finish verification


//////////////////////////////////

(in-class quiz)

//////////////////////////////////

Four steps:

1) What should be done before calling the function?




2) What can the function itself do with the preconditions?




3) What must the function do with the postconditions?




4) What can the calling code do with the postcondition after
    the function returns? 






/////////////////////////////////

Example: put our abs code in a function (absFn.sc)

(will finish this example on Thursday)

/////////////////////////////////

Recursive functions

- exactly the same idea

if (base case condition) {
    answer = base case
} else {

    //what to do here?

    recursive call

    //what can we do here?

    answer = recursive call case
}

//if we want some postcondition after an if/else, what do we do?

return answer



/////////////////////////////////

Example (mult_rec.sc):

- multiplication through repeated (recursive) addition
- write function contract
- do verification

/////////////////////////////

Next time:
- verifying functions with loops
