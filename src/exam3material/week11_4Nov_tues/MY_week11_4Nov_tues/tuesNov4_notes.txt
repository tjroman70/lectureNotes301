HW 8 due tonight

#1: Give a recursive definition of the function Product(m, n),
where Product(m, n) is the product of the integer m and
the nonnegative integer n




#5: Use proof by contradiction to prove that the sum of a rational and
irrational number is irrational.

How to write as an IF/THEN?




Rational definition?




How to start the proof? 






HW 9 will be posted after class

///////////////////////////////

Today:

- Begin programming logic



Apply proof techniques and similar reasoning to prove correctness
of basic programs.

(Why does this matter?)
avionics



AWS formal methods



Drone flight 
kernel on the drone has cyber security on it to try to not get hacked


////////////////////////////

Programs are written in Slang, which is a subset of Scala. We will
study:
    - variables (boolean, int, sequences)
    - printing and user input
    - math operations
    - conditional operations
    - if and if/else statements
    - while loops
    - functions


--> Logika/Slang were created by the Santos lab in the CS dept.
    --> has funding from DARPA, Air Force for model checking


--> Can run on the JVM
--> Slang can also be compiled to C
--> can demonstrate program correctness down to machine code
--> more info: https://slang.sireum.org/about/


--> gives you semantic verfication, unlike test cases (verification)
--> lets you learn programming project by applying manually, then 
    switch to automatic verification based on specifications



Basic program #1
    - get user input number, add one to it, print it out

Basic program #2
    - get user input number, print whether it is positive or negative

Basic program #3
    - use a loop to print the numbers from 10 down to 1

Basic program #4
    - write a separate function to add all elements in a sequence
    - create a sequence, call the function, print the result




First: prove program correctness in "manual" mode
    (we have to process the knowledge gained
    in each statement)


Then: prove program correctness in "auto" mode
    - we provide function contracts and loop invariants
    - checker can make sure our program meets our
    specifications


////////////////////////

Preconditions: Assumptions we need to make about input or parameters to prove correctness


Postconditions: describe the results of the running program


/////

assume statements
    - lets us make assumptions about user input
    - we can pull these assumptions into a proof



Example:
    var input: Z = Z.prompt("Enter a positive number: ")
    assume(input > 0)

/////

assert statements
    - what we want to prove is true after some code
        (postconditions)

    - must prove EXACTLY that statement before we assert it



assert(some claim)


How are Logika asserts different from C# (and other languages)?

Logika: checks if we prove something
other languages: actually runs the code and compares values



////////////////////////

Process of validating a program:



(any assumptions needed about user input - assume)

program statement

(claims/asserts)

program statement

(claims/asserts)

program statement

(claims/asserts about output/results/postconditions)






///////////////////////////////

Claims go in "proof blocks", which look like:

Deduce(
    //line numbers with claims and justifications
    //similar to prop/pred logic proofs

    x ( claim ) by Justification(params)
)

//////////////////////////////

Justifications (for now):

Premise




Example:

var input: Z = Z.prompt("Enter a positive number: ")
assume(num > 0)
var y: Z = 12

//proof block? what would go there?




////

Algebra* (or Algebra T)

    var x: Z = 2

    Deduce(
        1 ( x == 2 ) by Premise,
        2 ( x >= 2 ) by Algebra*(1)
        3 ( 4 > 0 ) by Algebra T
    )



////

ANY of your propositional/predicate logic justifications
    (especially AndE1, AndE2, AndI, OrI1, OrI2)




//////////////////////////////

(add.sc)
Example: write a program that creates a number, x, with value 2

Create a value, y, that is initialized to x + 2

We want to assert at the end that y is 4



//////////////////////////////

(in-class quiz)


//////////////////////////////

Example (max.sc):

get 2 user inputs: x and y
assume that x > y
set a max variable to x

want to assert that max is the biggest of our two inputs

///////////////////////////////

The Algebra* justification works for most mathematical manipulations

Will not work on claims involving ∧, ∨, →, ∀, ∃

y == z
x == 2 ∧ x == y

x == 2 ∧ x == z

Another justification: Subst









/////////////////////////////

Subst_<(m, n)



Deduce(
    ...
    m ( LHS_M == RHS_M ),      //must be an equivalence
    ...
    n ( claim1 ),
    ...
    j ( claim2 )              by Subst_<(m, n)
)

claim2 rewrites claim1 by substituting all occurrences of
    LHS_M with RHS_M


Think of Subst_< as LHS <- RHS

    (the RHS is coming in for each LHS)
    (the < points at the value we are REPLACING)


Example:

Deduce(
    ...
    m ( x + 1 == y - 4 ),
    ...
    n ( x*(x + 1) == (x + 1) + y ),
    ...
    j ( x*(y-4) == (y-4) + y )     by Subst_<(m, n)
)





/////////////////////////////

Subst_>(,m n)

Deduce(
    ...
    m ( LHS_M == RHS_M ),      //must be an equivalence
    ...
    n ( claim1 ),
    ...
    j ( claim2 )             by Subst_>(m, n)
)

claim2 rewrites claim1 by substituting all occurrences of
    RHS_M with LHS_M


Think of Subst_> as LHS -> RHS

    (the LHS is coming in for each RHS)
    (the > points at the value we are REPLACING)


Example:

Deduce(
    ...
    m ( x + 1 == y )
    ...
    n ( y*(x + 1) == (x + 1) + y )
    ...
    j ( (x+1)*(x + 1) == (x + 1) + x + 1 ) by Subst_>(m, n)
)





/////////////////////////////////

Example (code fragment):

val num: Z = x + 2
val answer: Z = 4*num + 8
val another: Z = 5 - (x + 2)*3


Deduce(
    1 ( num == x + 2 )              by Premise,
    2 ( answer == 4*num + 8 )       by Premise,
    3 ( another == 5 - (x+2)*3 )    by Premise,

    //substitute in for "num" in "answer"
    4 

    //substitute in for "x+2" in "another"
    5 
)


//////////////////////////////

Assignment with mutation


var x: Z = 2

//what could we put in a proof block here?



x = x + 2       //what do we know about x?


//what might we try to put in a proof block here?
//would it make sense?



x = x + 4




//////////////////////////////

If you change the value of variable "name", write that claim
using:

    Old(name)

in the very next proof block. Only ONE "Old" value exists
at a time.


The Old(name) refers to value of the variable just before
the latest update.

Goal: state that variable's current value WITHOUT using Old
by the end of next proof block


y = y + 4

Deduce(
    ???
)

x = x + 3

Deduce(
    ???
    //what "Old" values are available?
)

//////////////////////

Example (add3.sc):

- get an input number
- save out an "orig" value that is equal to the input

add 1 to the input number
add 2 to the input number

want to assert that the resulting number is 3 more than the orig value



--> what if we added an assume that the input number
    was positive?

--> could we add to our assert that the resulting number
    is positive?
