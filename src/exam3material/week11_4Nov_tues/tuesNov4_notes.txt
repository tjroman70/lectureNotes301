HW 8 due tonight

#1: Give a recursive definition of the function Product(m, n),
where Product(m, n) is the product of the integer m and
the nonnegative integer n

base case: n == 0. Product(m, 0) is 0
recursive case, n > 0. 




#5: Use proof by contradiction to prove that the sum of a rational and
irrational number is irrational.

How to write as an IF/THEN?

IF r is rational and i is irrational, THEN r+i is irrational.


Rational definition?
r is a rational number if r = p/q where p,q are integers and q != 0.



How to start the proof? 

Assume r is rational and i is irrational.
Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that r+i is rational.

If r is rational, then r = p/q where p,q are integers and q != 0.
If r+i is irrational, then r+i = a/b where a,b are integers and b != 0.

i = r+i - r
    = a/b - p/q


    want : (numerator)/(denominator)

(goal: contradiction)




HW 9 will be posted after class

///////////////////////////////

Today:

- Begin programming logic



Apply proof techniques and similar reasoning to prove correctness
of basic programs.

(Why does this matter?)
avionics, spacecraft
medical software 


AWS formal methods



Drone flight 



////////////////////////////

Programs are written in Slang, which is a subset of Scala. We will
study:
    - variables (boolean, int, sequences)
    - printing and user input
    - math operations
    - conditional operations
    - if and if/else statements
    - while loops
    - functions


--> Logika/Slang were created by the Santos lab in the CS dept.
    --> has funding from DARPA, Air Force for model checking


--> Can run on the JVM, in the browser
--> Slang can also be compiled to C
--> can demonstrate program correctness down to machine code
--> more info: https://slang.sireum.org/about/


--> gives you semantic verification, unlike test cases (verification)
--> lets you learn programming project by applying manually, then 
    switch to automatic verification based on specifications



Basic program #1
    - get user input number, add one to it, print it out

Basic program #2
    - get user input number, print whether it is positive or negative

Basic program #3
    - use a loop to print the numbers from 10 down to 1

Basic program #4
    - write a separate function to add all elements in a sequence
    - create a sequence, call the function, print the result




First: prove program correctness in "manual" mode
    (we have to process the knowledge gained
    in each statement)


Then: prove program correctness in "auto" mode
    - we provide function contracts and loop invariants
    - checker can make sure our program meets our
    specifications


////////////////////////

Preconditions: assumptions we need to make make about input or 
    parameters in order to prove correctness


Postconditions: describe the results of running the code
    formally describe what we know at end of a function call
    or at end of a chunk of code


our goal is to prove the postconditions 

/////

assume statements
    - lets us make assumptions about user input
    - we can pull these assumptions into a proof



Example:
    var input: Z = Z.prompt("Enter a positive number: ")
    assume(input > 0)

/////

assert statements
    - what we want to prove is true after some code
        (postconditions)

    - must prove EXACTLY that statement before we assert it



assert(some claim)


How are Logika asserts different from C# (and other languages)?


Logika: checks if we've proved something

Other languages: actually runs the code and compares values 


////////////////////////

Process of validating a program:



(any assumptions needed about user input - assume)

program statement

(claims/asserts)

program statement

(claims/asserts)

program statement

(claims/asserts about output/results/postconditions)






///////////////////////////////

Claims go in "proof blocks", which look like:

Deduce(
    //line numbers with claims and justifications
    //similar to prop/pred logic proofs

    x ( claim ) by Justification(params)
)

//////////////////////////////

Justifications (for now):

Premise




Example:

var input: Z = Z.prompt("Enter a positive number: ")
assume(input > 0)
var y: Z = 12

//proof block? what would go there?

Deduce( 
    1 ( y == 12 ) by Premise,
    2 ( input > 0 ) by Premise,
)


////

Algebra* (or Algebra T)

    var x: Z = 2

    Deduce(
        1 ( x == 2 ) by Premise,
        2 ( x >= 2 ) by Algebra*(1)
        3 ( 4 > 0 ) by by Algebra T
    )



////

ANY of your propositional/predicate logic justifications
    (especially AndE1, AndE2, AndI, OrI1, OrI2)




//////////////////////////////

(add.sc)
Example: write a program that creates a number, x, with value 2

Create a value, y, that is initialized to x + 2

We want to assert at the end that y is 4



//////////////////////////////

(in-class quiz)


//////////////////////////////

Example (max.sc):

get 2 user inputs: x and y
assume that x > y
set a max variable to x

want to assert that max is the biggest of our two inputs

///////////////////////////////

<-- stopped here, will continue Thursday

///////////////////////////////

The Algebra* justification works for most mathematical manipulations

Will not work on claims involving ∧, ∨, →, ∀, ∃

y == z
x == 2 ∧ x == y

x == 2 ∧ x == z

Another justification: Subst









/////////////////////////////

Subst_<(m, n)



Deduce(
    ...
    m ( LHS_M == RHS_M ),      //must be an equivalence
    ...
    n ( claim1 ),
    ...
    j ( claim2 )              by Subst_<(m, n)
)

claim2 rewrites claim1 by substituting all occurrences of
    LHS_M with RHS_M


Think of Subst_< as LHS <- RHS

    (the RHS is coming in for each LHS)
    (the < points at the value we are REPLACING)


Example:

Deduce(
    ...
    m ( x + 1 == y - 4 ),
    ...
    n ( x*(x + 1) == (x + 1) + y ),
    ...
    j ( x*(y-4) == (y-4) + y )     by Subst_<(m, n)
)





/////////////////////////////

Subst_>(,m n)

Deduce(
    ...
    m ( LHS_M == RHS_M ),      //must be an equivalence
    ...
    n ( claim1 ),
    ...
    j ( claim2 )             by Subst_>(m, n)
)

claim2 rewrites claim1 by substituting all occurrences of
    RHS_M with LHS_M


Think of Subst_> as LHS -> RHS

    (the LHS is coming in for each RHS)
    (the > points at the value we are REPLACING)


Example:

Deduce(
    ...
    m ( x + 1 == y )
    ...
    n ( y*(x + 1) == (x + 1) + y )
    ...
    j ( (x+1)*(x + 1) == (x + 1) + x + 1 ) by Subst_>(m, n)
)





/////////////////////////////////

Example (code fragment):

val num: Z = x + 2
val answer: Z = 4*num + 8
val another: Z = 5 - (x + 2)*3


Deduce(
    1 ( num == x + 2 )              by Premise,
    2 ( answer == 4*num + 8 )       by Premise,
    3 ( another == 5 - (x+2)*3 )    by Premise,

    //substitute in for "num" in "answer"
    4 

    //substitute in for "x+2" in "another"
    5 
)


//////////////////////////////

Assignment with mutation


var x: Z = 2

//what could we put in a proof block here?



x = x + 2       //what do we know about x?


//what might we try to put in a proof block here?
//would it make sense?



x = x + 4




//////////////////////////////

If you change the value of variable "name", write that claim
using:

    Old(name)

in the very next proof block. Only ONE "Old" value exists
at a time.


The Old(name) refers to value of the variable just before
the latest update.

Goal: state that variable's current value WITHOUT using Old
by the end of next proof block


y = y + 4

Deduce(
    ???
)

x = x + 3

Deduce(
    ???
    //what "Old" values are available?
)

//////////////////////

Example (add3.sc):

- get an input number
- save out an "orig" value that is equal to the input

add 1 to the input number
add 2 to the input number

want to assert that the resulting number is 3 more than the orig value



--> what if we added an assume that the input number
    was positive?

--> could we add to our assert that the resulting number
    is positive?

- verifying programs with modulus and division
