HW 4 problem 6

p → q   equivalent to   ¬p ∨ q


p → q  ⊢  ¬p ∨ q

    Try PbC. Assume ¬(¬p ∨ q)
        Goal: ¬p (if we had that, could contradict with assume)
        Use NegI to try to get ¬p
            Assume p 
            goal: F

        goal: F (contradiction)
     



¬p ∨ q   ⊢  p → q

use ImplyI to try to get p → q
    Assume p 
        try OrE on premise to get q in both cases 
    Goal q 


/////////////////////////

HW 4 problem 7

¬(p → q)    equivalent to   p ∧ ¬q


¬(p → q)  ⊢  p ∧ ¬q
    try PbC to get p ∧ ¬q
        Assume ¬(p ∧ ¬q)

        Try to use ImplyI to get p → q to contradict with premise
            Assume p 
                Try to use PbC to get our goal of q 
                    Assume ¬q

                    goal: F 

            goal: q

        goal: F



p ∧ ¬q   ⊢   ¬(p → q)

Use NegI to get conclusion. Assume p → q


/////////////////////////

How do we approach proofs?

1. Write out all the premises
2. Extract all information from premises 
        AND statement - break apart both sides
        IMPLIES statement - see if we have or can get
                        the IF part, then use ImplyE

3. Look at what you are trying to prove 
    (what do we look for in goal/conclusion?)
    top level operator

    ∧ - try to prove both sides separately, then put them 
        together

    ∨ - can you get one of the two sides? Use OrI to get conclusion. 
        see if you have an OR statement as a premise 
            or a previous claim. If you do, use OrE.
        if nothing else works, try PbC on the whole conclusion.  

    → - open ImplyI subproof. Assume the if (LHS) part and try 
        to get to the then part (RHS).

    ¬(something) - open NegI subproof. Assume "something".
        Goal: F 

    just a propositional atom? like p.
        find where it appears in a premise or previous 
        claim. Think about what you would need to do to 
        extract it.

        Try OrE if an OR statement is available.

        If nothing works, try PbC. Assume ¬p, try to get F.


After each claim - see if there is anything else to 
    extract. Scan earlier claims to see if you can put 
    them together with new claims. 



Inside a subproof - write down what your goal is.
    OrE, ImplyI, PbC, NegI 

    OrE - need to already have an OR statement.
        your goal in both subproofs is whatever your
        current goal is when you open those subproofs.

    ImplyI - have to assume the LHS. Goal must be the RHS.

    PbC - assume must be a NOT statement. Goal is F.
        Afterwards must conclude the assume statement 
        without the not.

    NegI - assume whatever. Goal must be F.
        Afterwards must conclude ¬(assume)



Doesn't fit a pattern or doesn't work out from above?

    OrE, PbC 

If you get stuck in an OrE subproof and can't get to your
    goal, see if you can get F and then use BottomE.


--> when do we open a subproof?





--> can we assume anything in a subproof?

Bigger example: big.sc

//////////////////////////////////

A THEOREM in propositional logic is something that is
always true with no need for premises. For example:


Law of the excluded middle. (LEM)

p ∨ ¬p



What would a theorem be in a truth table?
tautology



Prove LEM (lem.sc):

⊢ ( p ∨ ¬p )               //lem.sc



⊢ (theorem that you are trying to prove)

/////////////////////////////////

SOUNDNESS and COMPLETENESS of natural deduction in
    propositional logic

    "provable": prove using natural deduction
    "true": demonstrate an argument with truth tables


SOUNDNESS: everything that is provable is actually true

p ∧ q 
--------
p


COMPLETENESS: everything that is true is provable





--> what would it mean if a proof system was unsound?

I could prove things that are not true. 

This would be baaaaaad.


--> what would it mean if a proof system was incomplete?

There would be true (valid) arguments that I could not
    prove with my proof system. 


Propositional logic is both SOUND and COMPLETE.



Using natural deduction to prove the sequent:
    P1, P2, ..., Pn ⊢ q


Is equivalent to using truth tables to show that whenever
    P1, P2, ..., Pn
are true, then q is also true

(in-class quiz)

//////////////////////////////////////

Sets.

A set is an unordered collection of elements


{1,1,3,5,7} = {1,3,5,7} = {7,3,1,5}



∈: is in, exists in

    x ∈ A: x exists in set A, x is in A

    x ∉ A: x does not exist in set A, x is not in A



Example: A = {1,4,7,11,20}

    1 ∈ A 
    2 ∉ A



- Common sets in math:

    ℕ: natural numbers (positive integers)
        1, 2, 3, ...
    ℤ: all integers (-5, 4, ..., 0, 1, 2, ...)
    ℚ: rational numbers, p/q where p and q are integers
        and q != 0
    ℝ: real numbers (numbers with decimal)
    ℂ: complex numbers 
    ∅: empty set

ℕ ⊂ ℤ ⊂ ℚ ⊂ ℝ ⊂ ℂ

////////////////////////////////////

Set builder notation.

: means, where, such that
| means the same thing

{variable : conditions}


{x: x ∈ ℕ, 5 ≤ x ≤ 10}

{5,6,7,8,9,10}



{k : k is a letter in "abracadabra"}

{a,b,r,c,d}


{x : x = 2k,  k ∈ ℕ}

{2, 4, 8, 10, ...}




{n : n = k^2, k ∈ Z}

{0, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...}


{n : n = 3a + 1, a ∈ ℕ, 1 ≤ a ≤ 4}

{4, 7, 10, 13}

<-- stopped here, will continue on Thursday

Describe these sets in set builder notation


{5,10,15}



{CIS 115, CIS 200, CIS 300, CIS 301}



{2,4,8,16,32}


///////////////////////////////////////
∀ ∃     ∈ ∉     ∅ ⋂ ⋃ ⊂ ⊆   ⋀ ⋁ ¬ →     ℕ ℤ     ≠ ≤ ≥

///////////////////////////////////////

Set union, ⋃

The union of the sets A and B, written A ⋃ B, is the set
of all elements....?


How could we express in set builder notation?

A ⋃ B =


//////////////////////////////////////
⋃ ⋂ ⋁ ⋀ ∈ ∉
///////////////////////////////////////

Set intersection, ⋂

The intersection of the sets A and B, written A ⋂ B, is the set
of all elements that are...?


How could we express in set builder notation?

A ⋂ B =

///////////////////////////////////////

Set difference,

/ or \ (means the same thing)

The difference between the sets A and B, written A - B, is the set
of all elements...?


How could we express in set builder notation?

A - B =

//////////////////////////////////////
⋃ ⋂ ⋁ ⋀ ∈ ∉
///////////////////////////////////////

A = {1,3,7,10,11,12}

B = {2,3,4,5,6,7}


Find:

A ⋃ B =

A ⋂ B =

A - B =

B - A =


//////////////////

Subset - A is a subset of B, written A ⊆ B, if
    all elements in A are also in B.

(We say A ⊂ B if A is a subset of B but A ≠ B.)




Example:

A = {1,3,4}

B = {1,3,5,8}

--> is A a subset of B?



A = {8,1,3}

B = {1,3,5,8}

--> is A a subset of B?
