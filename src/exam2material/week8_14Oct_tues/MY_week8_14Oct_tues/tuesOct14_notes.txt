HW 6 is due tonight

Exam 2 is Thursday, October 16 during class

Jacob is having exam review today, 4-5:30 in DUE 1118

No new homework this week

///////////////////////////////

Today:
- A little more with AllE, AllI
- ExistsI
- Review for Exam 2

///////////////////////

Reminder:

AllE - use when we have a specific individual, can plug into 
    any for all statement

AllI - subproof (starts with "Let"), choosing random individual
    end subproof with a statement about our random individual
    right after subproof ends, claim same statement about All
    individuals

////////////////////////

Bigger example: allBig.sc

////////////////////////

Idea behind exists-introduction (ExistsI):

If we find ONE individual in a domain where a statement holds

...then THERE EXISTS an individual in the domain where the
    statement holds



///

Rule definition:

                  P(v)
ExistsI[T]: ---------------------
              ∃ ((x: T) => P(x) )

//v is some individual of type T


//////////////////////////////////////////

Rule syntax:


( Human(Socrates) ) ⊢ ( ∃ ((x: T) => Human(x) ))
Proof(
    1 ( Human(Socrates) ) by Premise,
    2 ( ∃ ((x: T) => Human(x)) )  by ExistsI[T](1)
)

(assume "Socrates" was a parameter of type T)

/////////////////////////////////////////

Bigger example (exists1.sc):

(
    ∀ ((x: T) => (Human(x) → Mortal(x))),
    Human(Socrates)
)
⊢ ( ∃ ((x: T) => Mortal(x) ))

Exam 2:
- Thursday, October 16 9:30-10:45
- Closed notes, closed computers

- Natural deduction proofs in propositional logic, esp. with:
    ImplyI, NegE, NegI, BottomE, PbC
--> still expected to be familiar with all other rules
--> may be more emphasis here than previous semesters,
    as more of these rules are on Exam 2 than in the past

Sets, including:
    - set builder notation
    - N (natural, all positive, starts at 1), Z (integers),
            R (reals - includes whole numbers, fractions,
            numbers with decimals)
    - union, intersection, difference (-), subsets
    - Venn diagrams
    - general reasoning about sets

Predicate logic statements, including:
    - quantifiers
    - interpreting predicate logic statements in English
    - translating English statements to predicate logic
    - evaluating predicate logic statements in a domain
    - working with predicate logic statements involving sets
        of numbers
    - DeMorgan's laws
    - negating predicate logic statements

- Natural deduction proofs in predicate logic
    using: AllE, AllI, ExistsI

- Using natural deduction to prove two statements are equivalent



--> what about predicate logic proof syntax?
    don't care about getting all the ()
    don't care about putting : T or [T]
    in AllI subproof, be sure to name your random individual
    can write ∀((x: T) => (P(x) -> Q(x))) like
        ∀ x (P(x) -> Q(x))


--> how to prepare?
    do practice quizzes in Canvas
    review homework solutions (they are posted)

    get out paper
    work through old homework problems
    work through old lecture examples

    do extra propositional logic examples in exam2_propExamples.txt

    go to exam review at 4:00!

///////////////////////////////////////

Work through practice exam (will post solution after class)
