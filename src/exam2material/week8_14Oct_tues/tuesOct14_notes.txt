HW 6 is due tonight

Exam 2 is Thursday, October 15 during class

No new homework this week

///////////////////////////////

Today:
- A little more with AllE, AllI
- ExistsI
- Review for Exam 2

///////////////////////

Reminder:

AllE - use when we have a specific individual, can plug into 
    any for all statement

AllI - subproof (starts with "Let"), choosing random individual
    end subproof with a statement about our random individual
    right after subproof ends, claim same statement about All
    individuals

////////////////////////

Bigger example: allBig.sc

////////////////////////

Idea behind exists-introduction (ExistsI):

If we find ONE individual in a domain where a statement holds

...then THERE EXISTS an individual in the domain where the
    statement holds



///

Rule definition:

                  P(v)
ExistsI[T]: ---------------------
              ∃ ((x: T) => P(x) )

//v is some individual of type T


//////////////////////////////////////////

Rule syntax:


( Human(Socrates) ) ⊢ ( ∃ ((x: T) => Human(x) ))
Proof(
    1 ( Human(Socrates) ) by Premise,
    2 ( ∃ ((x: T) => Human(x)) )  by ExistsI[T](1)
)

(assume "Socrates" was a parameter of type T)

/////////////////////////////////////////

Bigger example (exists1.sc):

(
    ∀ ((x: T) => (Human(x) → Mortal(x))),
    Human(Socrates)
)
⊢ ( ∃ ((x: T) => Mortal(x) ))

Exam 2:
- Thursday, March 13 9:30-10:45
- Closed notes, closed computers
- All "open-ended" problems - similar to HW 4-6

- Natural deduction proofs in propositional logic, esp. with:
    ImplyI, NegE, NegI, BottomE, PbC
--> still expected to be familiar with all other rules
--> may be more emphasis here than previous semesters,
    as more of these rules are on Exam 2 than in the past

Sets, including:
    - set builder notation
    - N (natural, all positive, starts at 1), Z (integers),
            R (reals - includes whole numbers, fractions,
            numbers with decimals)
    - union, intersection, difference (-), subsets
    - Venn diagrams
    - general reasoning about sets

Predicate logic statements, including:
    - quantifiers
    - interpreting predicate logic statements in English
    - translating English statements to predicate logic
    - evaluating predicate logic statements in a domain
    - working with predicate logic statements involving sets
        of numbers
    - DeMorgan's laws
    - negating predicate logic statements

- Natural deduction proofs in predicate logic
    using: AllE, AllI, ExistsI

- Using natural deduction to prove two statements are equivalent



--> what about predicate logic proof syntax?
    don't care about getting all the ()
    don't care about putting : T or [T]
    in AllI subproof, be sure to name your random individual
    can write ∀((x: T) => (P(x) -> Q(x))) like
        ∀ x (P(x) -> Q(x))


--> how to prepare?
    do practice quizzes in Canvas
    review homework solutions (they are posted)

    get out paper
    work through old homework problems
    work through old lecture examples

///////////////////////////////////////

Work through practice exam (will post solution after class)
