Today:
- quick discussion of specifications in practice
- review for final exam



////////////////////////////////////


What to do with preconditions and postconditions in practice?

precondition violated?
    function will throw an exception (and leave)
    so that we only complete function if the precondition was met


postcondition check?
    assert postcondition



--> why might this would be preferable to only using test cases?



See Java API

/////////////////////////////

Global invariants in practice.

--> write globalsAssert method to assert each global invariant

--> where should we call it?

at the beginning of a function
at the end of a function

Final exam: Tuesday, December 16 2:00-3:50 in DUE 1109 (here)
**Midterm equivalent from final exam



Office hour times during finals week.



Closed notes, closed computers

Cumulative. Similar format as previous exams.

- recommend reviewing previous exams and practice exams
- recommend reworking in-class and practice quizzes

- final exam practice problems
    --> these don't include all possible problem types
    --> all topics include:
        - all topics listed for Exam 1
        - all topics listed for Exam 2
        - all topics listed for Exam 3
        - verifying programs with sequences
        - verifying programs with global variables and global invariants
        - termination


(How to find list of topics from previous exams?)


//////////////////////////////////

Do **sequence (#9), **globals (#10), **loop/function program (#7) first


<-- then in-class quiz
