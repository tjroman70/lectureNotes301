Today:
- quick discussion of specifications in practice
- review for final exam


Office hour times during finals week.


////////////////////////////////////


What to do with preconditions and postconditions in practice?

precondition violated?


postcondition check?



--> why might this would be preferable to only using test cases?



See Java API

/////////////////////////////

Global invariants in practice.

--> write globalsAssert method to assert each global invariant

--> where should we call it?

        - all topics listed for Exam 1
        - all topics listed for Exam 2
        - all topics listed for Exam 3
        - verifying programs with sequences
        - verifying programs with global variables and global invariants
        - termination


(How to find list of topics from previous exams?)


//////////////////////////////////

Do sequence (#9), globals (#10), loop program (#7) first


<-- then in-class quiz
