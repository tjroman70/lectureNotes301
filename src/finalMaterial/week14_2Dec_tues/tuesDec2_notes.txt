////////////////////////////

HW 11 will be posted after class, due Tues Dec 9
    --> this is the last assignment
    --> I HIGHLY recommend completing it 
        (even if you are able to use it as one of your drops)



/////////////////////////////

Today:

- Logika modes
- Verifying programs with sequences


Rest of semester:
- Verifying programs with global invariants
- Proving termination
- If time, see how to do similar function contracts in Java

//////////////////////////////

Logika modes.

Default/manual mode - what we've been doing.

auto mode - only needs function contracts and invariant blocks.
    --> can do all intermediate reasoning itself.

--> Mode is defined in your "starter" files at the top



For manual:

    //@Logika: --manual


For auto, that line is deleted



**All HW 11 problems will use auto mode

////////////////////////////

Example: See what we can change in multiplication example
    (mult_loop.sc)




///////////////////////////

Sequences. (like an array or list)

--> see sequence operations (seqOp.sc)

--> Want to ensure sequence position is always valid

--> sequences are passed to a function by reference
    --> postcondition should describe how a sequence changes

///////////////////////////

Making claims about sequences.

Suppose "seq" is our sequence



∀ (lower until upper)(k => some statement about seq(k) )
    (does NOT include upper)


∀ (0 until seq.size)(k => seq(k) == 0 )
    
    --> what does this say? all element in seq are 0

∀ (0 until seq.size)(k => In(seq)(k) > 0 ->  seq(k) == 0 )

    --> what does this say? all elements that were initially positive
            have been set to 0


∀ (lower to upper)(k => some statement about seq(k) )
    (DOES include upper)



Similarly, can use ∃

∃ (0 until seq.size)(k => seq(k) == 0 )

    --> what does this say? one of the positions in seq has been set to 0

///////////////////////////

Writing function contract for function with a sequence:

- Requires:
    - Sequence size? have requirements to make sure function code won't 
        cause index out of bounds problem
    - Index parameters? that they be valid positions in the sequence
- Modifies: when needed? if the function changes a sequence parameter
- Ensures:
    - What to describe about sequence?
        the value of EVERY position in the sequence after calling the function
    - What about return values?
        Res[Z]




Use "In(seq)" refers to the state of a sequence at the
    beginning of the function call
    "seq" means value at the end of the function call


///////////////////////////

Example: function that sets first element in a sequence to 0
(seqZeroFirst.sc)


//////////////////////////

in-class quiz

///////////////////////////

Example: function that sets some position in a sequence to 0
(seqZeroPos.sc)

///////////////////////////

Example: swap function
(swap.sc)

///////////////////////////

<-- stopped here, will continue on Thursday

///////////////////////////

Functions with sequences and loops.
--> same idea, but loop invariant block needs to:
    - Describe what has been changed so far about the sequence
    - (Often) describe what has NOT changed so far in the sequence
    - Bound the loop counter
    - State that the sequence size doesn't change (if changing the sequence)

//////////////////////////

Example: function that sets every position in a sequence to 10
(seqAll10.sc)


//////////////////////////

--> what if instead setting everything to 10,
    we added one to each element?

//////////////////////////

Next time:
- More sequences and loops
- Programs with multiple functions
- Begin global invariants
