HW 3 due tonight - don't add parentheses


Problem 6:

//(p ∨ q) ∨ r
//(r ∨ q) ∨ p
p ∨ q ∨ r |- r ∨ q ∨ p

vs

p ∨ (q ∨ r)  


using: (p ∨ q) ∨ r
OrE subproofs:

1) assume p ∨ q
    nest OrE subproof
    1) assume P
        goal: r ∨ q ∨ p

    2) assume q
        goal: r ∨ q ∨ p

goal: r ∨ q ∨ p

2) assume r

goal: r ∨ q ∨ p

no new homework this week

Exam 1 is Thursday, September 18

////////////////////////////////

Today:
- Proof of distributive law
- Implies elimination
- Exam 1 review

////////////////////////////////

Proving two statements are equivalent with deduction?


statement1
statement2

Proof 1: statement1 |- statement2


Proof 2: statement2 |- statement1

////////////////////////////////

Example: prove one of the distributive laws

p ∨ (q ∧ r)     is equivalent to       (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ r)


(orDist1.sc and orDist2.sc)



////////////////////////////////

if (extraCredit == true || grade < 90) {
    if (extraCredit == true || grade >= 80) {
        //do stuff
    }
}

if (extraCredit == true || (grade >= 80 && grade < 90))


--> how does the distributive law tell us we can rewrite 
    this?


////////////////////////////////

Implies-elimination, ImplyE

          P, P → Q
ImplyE: -----------
            Q



(This rule is also called "modus ponens")

Example:

//Suppose we know x > 5. What can we conclude?

if (x > 5) {
    y = 17;
}

///////////////////////////////

Syntax for using ImplyE:

a ( P       )   by Justification,
b ( P → Q   )   by Justification,
c ( Q       )   by ImplyE(b, a)

__>:

////////////////////////////////////////

Example (imply1.sc):

(p ∧ q) → r,  p → q,  p  ⊢ r



Example (imply2.logika):

p → r,  q → r,  p ∨ q  ⊢ r

How to prove two propositional logic statements are 
equivalent?

    Approach 1: truth tables (2)
        for each truth assignment, both statements have the same 
        output

    Approach 2: deduction (2)
        statement1 |- statement2
        statement2 |- statement1




How to prove propositional logic statements are 
NOT equivalent?

find ONE counterexample (a truth assignment) where the
two statements have different output




What is satisfiability? 
    there exists at least one truth assignment that makes
    the statement output true

    ARE satisfiable: contingent, tautology
    NOT satisfiable: contradictory


    prove satisfiability: find ONE truth assignment
    prove NOT satisfiable: full truth table, show contradictory



- Determining whether an argument is valid or invalid
    (what is an argument?)
    premises, conclusion

    valid: every time all the premises are true then the conclusion
    is also true

    how prove valid?
        1) make a "combined" truth table, make sure every truth
        assignment that makes all premises true also makes the 
        conclusion true

        2) deduction

    how prove invalid?
        find one truth assignment that makes all premises true
        but the conclusion false

Closed notes/computers.


Mix of multiple choice (like quizzes) and open-ended (like homework)

Some problems will ask for a proof or explanation --
    read carefully!
